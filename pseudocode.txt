In our case, an operator must always produce a result. Therefore "A" operator "B" must always produce a result

/* Process Mapping */

When user inputs a number,
    store number in Array

When user selects an operator,
    store joined number in "A"
    store the operator in "operate"




When user inputs a second number, 
    store number in Array

    store in "B" and:
        If both "A" and "B" are not empty,
            store "A" operator "B" based on "operate" in "A"
            clear "B", and "operate"

When user inputs new operator,
    store operator in "operate"




When user inputs new number,
    store in "B" and:
    If both "A" and "B" are not empty,
        store "A" operator "B" based on "operate" in "A"
        clear "B", and "operate"

When user inputs "equal",
    return value of "A"
