In our case, an operator must always produce a result. Therefore "A" operator "B" must always produce a result

/* Process Mapping */

Global variables:
"A"
"B"
"Results"
"Operate"
"Placeholder" //for storing numbers



When user inputs a number,
    store number in Array //store()



When user selects an operator, //addition()
    store the operator in "operate"
    if "results" is empty and "A" is empty,
        store Array value in "A"
    else,
        store Array value in "B"

    clear Array

/* The problem with the above is that if nothing is selected before the operator, nothing is stored. Example is (results + future input) */
/* "B" is used again as the third value in the example scenario above */


When user inputs "equal" //equal()
    if "results" is empty and "B" is empty,
        store Array value in "B"
        store "A" operator "B" based on "operate" in "results"
    else,
        store "results" operator "B" based on "operate" in "results"

    clear "A", "B", and "operate"
    clear Array
    return "results"
