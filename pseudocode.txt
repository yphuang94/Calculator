In our case, an operator must always produce a result. Therefore "A" operator "B" must always produce a result

/* Process Mapping */

Global variables:
"A"
"B"
"Results"
"Operate"

When user inputs a number,
    store number in Array

When user selects an operator,
    store the operator in "operate"
    if "results" is empty and "A" is empty,
        store joined number in "A"
    else,
        store joined number in "B"

    clear Array

When user inputs "equal"
    if "results" is empty and "B" is empty,
        store joined number in "B"
        store "A" operator "B" based on "operate" in "results"
    else,
        store "results" operator "B" based on "operate" in "results"

    clear "A", "B", and "operate"
    clear Array
    return "results"





When user inputs new number,
    store in "B" and:
    If both "A" and "B" are not empty,
        store "A" operator "B" based on "operate" in "A"
        clear "B", and "operate"

When user inputs "equal",
    return value of "A"
