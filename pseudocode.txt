In our case, an operator must always produce a result. Therefore "A" operator "B" must always produce a result

/* Process Mapping */

Global variables:
"A"
"B"
"Results"
"Operate"
"Placeholder" //for storing numbers
"Numbers" //for combining numbers


When user inputs a number,
    store number in Array
    if "A" is empty,
        store Array value in "A"
    else,
        store Array value in "B"
    


When user selects an operator, //addition()
    store the operator in "operate"
    clear Array



When user inputs "equal" //equal()
    if "results" is empty and "B" is empty,
        store Array value in "B"
        store "A" operator "B" based on "operate" in "results"
    else,
        store "results" operator "B" based on "operate" in "results"

    clear "A", "B", and "operate"
    clear "placeholder"
    clear Array
    return "results"
